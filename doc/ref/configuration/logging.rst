Logging
=======

The salt project tries to get the logging to work for you and help us solve any 
issues you might find along the way.

If you want to get some more information on the *nitty-gritty* of salt's 
logging system, as a developer's point of view, please head over to the 
:doc:`logging development document</topics/development/logging>`.
If all you're after is an introduction to the salt logging configurations, as 
an end user point of view, please see the 
:ref:`master<master-logging-settings>` and 
:ref:`minion<minion-logging-settings>` configuration 
reference.
